A weather, news and currency converter SPA.  Written in React, it demonstrates use of both React Class component and hooks and AJAX with Fetch api. 
It allows to fetch weather for a chosen city via city search component. Material-UI used for CSS.


The news api used here is now only free in development mode (accessible form localhost). For a demo project this needs to be run locally.

### todo: 
error notifications
check city change & update
change the news api for a free one
